# B-ting Backend

B-ting backend is a Spring Boot REST API server for a travel planning and record-sharing service. It covers social
login, travel plans with AI-generated itineraries, place search backed by external tourism APIs, team travel with
invites, expense settlement, travel records with reviews and comments, regional chat, and file uploads to S3.

```

Each domain separates responsibilities into `controller`, `service`, `repository`, `entity`, and
`dto/request` / `dto/response`. Only functionality genuinely shared across domains belongs in `global`.

## How It Works

All domain controllers are exposed under the `/api/v1` prefix. `WebConfig` applies the prefix globally to every
`@RestController` under `com.butingbe.domain`, so `UserController` declares only `/users` while the external path
becomes `/api/v1/users/...`. Do not repeat `/api/v1` in a controller's `@RequestMapping`.

Request flow:

1. The client calls a controller under `/api/v1`.
2. Request DTOs are validated with Jakarta Validation and `@Valid`.
3. Authenticated endpoints resolve the caller through `@AuthenticationPrincipal AuthenticatedUser`, populated by
   `OpaqueTokenAuthenticationFilter`.
4. Services hold business rules; repositories read and write entities through Spring Data JPA.
5. Successes and failures are wrapped in `ApiResponse<T>`. Domain exceptions are converted to HTTP status codes by
   `GlobalExceptionHandler`.

## Local Database

Docker Compose runs only PostgreSQL. The Spring Boot application runs locally through Gradle.

Start PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

Check the container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps
```

Local PostgreSQL connection values:

| Key      | Value        |
|----------|--------------|
| Host     | `localhost`  |
| Port     | `5433`       |
| Database | `mydb`       |
| Username | `myuser`     |
| Password | `mypassword` |

Local container data is stored in `postgres_data/`. It is git-ignored — do not read, edit, or commit it.

## Database Migrations

Flyway owns the schema. Hibernate runs with `ddl-auto: validate`, so entity changes without a matching migration fail
at startup.

- Migrations live in `src/main/resources/db/migration` as `V<n>__<description>.sql`.
- Never edit a migration that has already been applied or shared. Add the next version number instead.
- Change the entity and the migration in the same unit of work.

## Run The Application

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root and fill in the values (`cp .env.example .env`). The Gradle `bootRun`
task loads `.env` and injects the values as environment variables before starting Spring Boot. `.env` is git-ignored —
never commit it or place real keys anywhere tracked. `.env.example` documents every key with dummy values and marks
which are required.

Minimum values for a local run (everything else has a default and only disables its feature when unset):

```dotenv
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/buting
DB_USERNAME=buting
DB_PASSWORD=changeme
```

Environment variables referenced by `application.yaml` (and the AWS default credential chain), by feature:

| Feature       | Variables                                                                                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Database      | `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` (required)                                                 |
| AI            | `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_MODEL`                                                           |
| Google OAuth  | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_AUDIENCES`, `GOOGLE_AND_DEBUG_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_AND_RELEASE_CLIENT_ID` |
| Naver OAuth   | `NAVER_CLIENT_ID`, `NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NAVER_REDIRECT_URI`                                    |
| Kakao OAuth   | `KAKAO_REST_API_KEY`, `KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `KAKAO_REDIRECT_URI`, `KAKAO_ALLOWED_AUDIENCES`, `KAKAO_AND_DEBUG_CLIENT_ID` |
| Place APIs    | `TOUR_API_BASE_URL`, `TOURISM_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_PLACES_BASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`         |
| S3            | `S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_REGION`, `S3_KEY_PREFIX`, `S3_MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `S3_PRESIGNED_URL_EXPIRATION`     |
| AWS creds     | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (local only; on EC2 use the instance IAM role)       |
| Upload limits | `FILE_MAX_SIZE`, `FILE_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`                                                          |
| Invitations   | `TRAVEL_INVITE_BASE_URL`                                                                          |
| Routing       | `ROUTE_GOOGLE_ENABLED` (off by default), `ROUTE_GOOGLE_API_KEY` (falls back to `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`) |
| Admin         | `ADMIN_TOKEN` (optional operator bootstrap token; unset disables it)                              |
| Zone Event    | `ZONE_EVENT_REVIEW_MODE`, `ZONE_EVENT_REPORT_AUTO_HIDE_THRESHOLD`, `ZONE_EVENT_REVIEW_CAPTURED_AT_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`, `ZONE_EVENT_ROUND_SCHEDULER_DELAY_MS`, `ZONE_EVENT_ROUND_SCHEDULER_INITIAL_DELAY_MS` (all optional, sensible defaults) |

Push notifications currently use a logging stub (`LoggingPushSender`); do not set `push.fcm.enabled` until a real
`FcmPushSender` is added.

Run the application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

`bootRun` also imports `application-oauth.yaml` from the classpath when present (optional, git-ignored). The task keeps
running while the server is alive; stop it with `Ctrl + C`. When running the packaged JAR, supply the same variables as
process environment variables, because `.env` loading is wired only into `bootRun`.

## Run Tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Run a single test class:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests 'com.butingbe.domain.user.service.UserServiceImplTest'
```

Integration tests use Testcontainers and start their own PostgreSQL container, so the local Docker Compose database
does not need to be running. Docker itself is required — if a test fails because Docker is unavailable, that is an
environment failure, not a code failure.

## Coverage

The build enforces **80% bundle line coverage** through `jacocoTestCoverageVerification`, which `check` depends on.

Excluded from the coverage gate:

- `**/ButingBeApplication*` — Spring Boot bootstrap class
- `**/global/config/**` — framework wiring
- `**/*Dto*` — data transfer objects

Do not widen these exclusions to get past the gate.

Run the coverage gate:

```bash
./gradlew jacocoTestReport jacocoTestCoverageVerification
```

Generated reports:

```text
build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml
```

## Verification

Run both before pushing:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
./gradlew check
```

`check` runs the tests, the JaCoCo report, and the coverage gate.

## Formatting

Java formatting is Spotless with Google Java Format. Do not hand-align code — run:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

The Husky **pre-push** hook runs `./gradlew spotlessApply check` automatically and blocks the push if Spotless modified
any file, so review and commit those changes before pushing again. The `pre-commit` hook intentionally does nothing,
which keeps commits easy to split.

Install the hooks once after cloning:

```bash
npm install
```

## Contributing

`dev` is the integration branch and `main` is the production branch.

1. Open or pick a GitHub issue. Large features use the `Parent Feature` template; the actual work is split into
   `Task / Sub-issue` items that reference `Parent: #<number>`.
2. Update remote `dev` and branch from it as `<type>/<short-description>` — for example `feature/storage-location` or
   `fix/oauth-token-validation`. Allowed types: `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `hotfix`.
3. Keep one issue per branch. Do not mix unrelated refactors, formatting, or dependency bumps.
4. Write Conventional Commits — `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`, for example `feat(storage): add luggage locker search API`.
   Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`. Reference issues with `Refs #<number>`.
5. Pass `./gradlew spotlessApply` and `./gradlew check` before pushing.
6. Open a pull request against `dev` — never from a feature branch straight to `main`. Fill in
   `.github/pull_request_template.md` and include `Closes #<number>` plus any API, DB, or configuration impact.
7. Merge only after CI passes and review is complete. Do not bypass a failing CI or lower the verification bar.
8. After merging, delete the branch and confirm the issue closed.

## CI

Pull requests targeting `dev` or `main` run `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which sets up Temurin Java 25 and runs
`./gradlew check --no-daemon`. The `check` status check is required on the `dev` branch (no review approval required).

### Auto-merge

`.github/workflows/automerge.yml` squash-merges a PR once its CI passes. It runs on `workflow_run` when the `CI`
workflow completes for a `pull_request`, finds the open PR for that commit, and merges it (with branch delete) only
when `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN` — a PR that is `BEHIND` dev, has conflicts (`DIRTY`), or is otherwise `BLOCKED` is
skipped, so a stale green check never merges an out-of-date branch. Only `dev`-targeted, non-draft PRs are eligible;
`main` release PRs are merged manually so the deploy workflow triggers. The workflow grants itself `contents` and
`pull-requests` write via its own `permissions:` block and merges with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Production Deployment

A push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which verifies the project, builds and pushes images tagged with
the immutable commit SHA plus `latest` to Docker Hub, and replaces the application container on EC2. EC2 does not clone
this repository. Do not push to `main` directly — release by merging a reviewed release PR from `dev`.

Configure these GitHub repository secrets:

```text
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
EC2_HOST
EC2_USER
EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
EC2_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS
```

The Amazon Linux instance uses `ec2-user`, so set `EC2_USER=ec2-user` and `EC2_HOST` to the Elastic IP. Before the first
deployment, install Docker with the Compose plugin and keep the existing `/home/ec2-user/app/docker-compose.yml` and
`/home/ec2-user/app/.env` files on EC2. The workflow updates only the Docker Hub namespace and `IMAGE_TAG` in that
`.env`, pulls the image tagged with the `main` commit SHA, recreates only the `app` container, and waits for port 8080
to accept connections before pruning old images.

For an RDS connection using `sslmode=verify-full`, set the JDBC URL's certificate parameter to
`sslrootcert=/app/certs/global-bundle.pem`. The AWS RDS global CA bundle ships at that path in the runtime image.
